                    <p class="aboutMe"> My name is Tom Ruff, this is my portfolio. I am currently a
                        full-time
                        student at
                        the U of U learning full-stack web development. This site is actually a project that I am
                        working on at the moment and need to finish before Saturday the 16th. I moved to Utah about 2
                        years ago now and have been working as a graphic designer for a sign company. Right now I have
                        committed to being a full-time student so I can fully immerse myself into learning this
                        material. I have a certificate in front end web development from CodeCademy back in 2018 but
                        wanted to take my learning to a much bigger scale. I have a huge passion for building sites and
                        learning about front and back end development. It is super fun and exciting when you learn
                        something new and are able to implement it to your project. I am super excited to get more
                        in-depth with back-end web development since that it was pretty difficult for me when I was
                        taking
                        the CodeCademy course. Some little things about me, I grew up in Illinois, have been
                        skateboarding since I was 2 years old and love all outdoors stuff and the casual video games.
                        Ever since moving to Utah I have started to mountain bike and will be snowboarding a ton this
                        year at snowbird. I love to build things mostly with wood but also like to weld and make gifts
                        for friends. Thank you to whoever has read this and hope this gave you a little picture of who I
                        am and what I like to do. </p>
